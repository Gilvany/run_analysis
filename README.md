# run_analysis
Clase 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 - UCI HAR Dataset

##Objective
#This script is used to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. It performs the following steps:

#1.  Merges the training and test datasets to create one data set.
#2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
#4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## README.md: Explains the analysis files and how all of the scripts are connected (this document).

## Dependencies
# run_analysis.R depends on the dplyr package for its execution. Please ensure that the package is installed and loaded prior to running the script.
